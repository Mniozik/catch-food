## Description

* At the beginning, you start with 3 hearts. Losing all of them results in losing the game.
* You lose hearts by catching falling items **that are not food** (you should avoid them).
* Bonuses appear randomly, providing speed boosts for your basket.
* The speed and frequency of falling items increase over time.
