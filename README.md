# Catch Food - PyGame 

## Description
 
* This project is an implementation of a game based on the `PyGame` library. 
* The goal of the game is to collect as much food as possible by moving a wicker basket using the arrow keys on the keyboard.
* You should avoid falling items that are not food (catching such items results in losing 1 heart). 
* At the beginning, you receive 3 hearts, losing all of them results in the end of the game.
